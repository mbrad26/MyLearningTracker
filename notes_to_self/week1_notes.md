### Encapsulation

Binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, keeping internal representation of an object hidden from outside interference.

Encapsulation tells us that we should know just the interface of the class to be able to use it.

The interface of a class is represented by its public methods - acceptable entry points into class.

Each object should know as litle as possible about the rest of the program.

### SRP 

The single responsibility principle (SRP) states that every object should do only one thing, should be responsible for just a single piece of that program’s functionality.

SRP is part of SOLID programming principles put forth by Robert Martin

SOLID:
  * Single Responsibility Principle — Classes should have a single responsibility and thus only a single reason to change.
  * Open/Closed Principle — Classes and other entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  * Liskov Substitution Principle — Objects should be replaceable by their subtypes.
  * Interface Segregation Principle — Interfaces should be client specific rather than general.
  * Dependency Inversion Principle — Depend on abstractions rather than concretions.
